# Glomeruli Detector
**This site introduces an example of a glomeruli detector that detects glomeruli from Whole Slide Images.**

We uses the [Faster RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) method and the [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) for its implementation.

## set up

Please set up by the following procedure.

1. Installing Tensorflow and Tensorflow Object Detection API

    Please run through the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) to install *"Tensorflow Object Detection API"* and all it dependencies.

2. Download our tools

    Please download our glomeruli detection programs.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jinseikenai/glomeruli_detection.git
    ```

1. dependencies

    Our glomeruli detection programs depends on the following libraries. Please install the following libraries.

    * [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/)

    Operation Environment：　We confirmed the operation in the following environment.

    * python 3.5
    * tensorflow 1.4.1


## Quick Start

  * [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/jinseikenai/glomeruli_detection/blob/master/detecting_glomeruli.md) for getting Started to detection of glomeruli with our [pre-traind models](#pre-trained_models) and [sample WSIs](#sample_wsi).

## <a name=pre-trained_models>Pre-trained models</a>

  We provide our pre-trained models trained on our WSI datasets.

  Each of them is pre-trained for each staining type.
  Please choose a pre-trained model in accord with your purpose of use among the following inside.
  
  * [PAS](http://www.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medinfo/download/jinai/faster_rcnn/trained_models/pas_train1.tar.gz) : for PAS(periodic acid-Schiff) stain slides.
  * [PAM](http://www.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medinfo/download/jinai/faster_rcnn/trained_models/pam_train1.tar.gz) : for PAM(periodic acid-methenamine silver) stain slides. 
  * [MT](http://www.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medinfo/download/jinai/faster_rcnn/trained_models/mt_train1.tar.gz) :  for MT(Masson trichrome) stain slides.
  * [Azan](http://www.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medinfo/download/jinai/faster_rcnn/trained_models/azan_train1.tar.gz) : for Azan stain slides.

  The downloaded files are compressed.
  You can un-tar each tar.gz file via, e.g.,:

  ```
  tar -xvfz pas.train1.tar.gz
  ```

  Even if there is no match exactly, if you find similar one in its characteristics, please try it.
  Or, you could try [Transfer Learning](#learning) on your data to detect glomeruli more correctly.

## <a name=sample_wsi>sample WSIs</a>

  The Whole Slide Images (WSIs) for your trial can be download from [here](http://www.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medinfo/download/jinai/faster_rcnn/test_data.tar.gz).
  These data are not included in the training data of our pre-trained models.

  Using these data, you could confirm the *Faster R-CNN-Based Glomerular Detector* and its result.
  Please see [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/jinseikenai/glomeruli_detection/blob/master/detecting_glomeruli.md) for how to do it.

## <a name='learning'>Transfer Learning / Additional Learning</a>

  Based on our pre-trained model, you could do your transfer learning or additional learning.

  For reference information on how to do learning, Please refer to the following notes, and my_train.py and my_trainer.py.

1. Data Preparation

  Please prepare a set of learning data and annotations showing correct answers.
  And see the TensorFlow's ["Preparing Inputs"](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/using_your_own_dataset.md) manual and [*Programmer's Guide:"Importing Data"*](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets).


2. Configuration

  Please configure a variable *"PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED*" in *"config/glomerulus_train.config"* and *"config/input.config*" appropriately to your environment.


3. Learning Execution

  You could execute learning with the following command.

  ```
  python my_train.py --logtostderr \
    --train_dir=${TRAIN_DATA_PATH} \
    --model_config_path=${CONFIG_PATH}/glomerulus_model.config \
    --train_config_path=${CONFIG_PATH}/glomerulus_train.config \
    --input_config_path=${CONFIG_PATH}/input.config \
    --gpu_list=${GPU}
  ```

  * Set the path of learning data to ${TRAIN_DATA_PATH}
  * Set the path of configuration files to ${CONFIG_PATH}.
  * Set the path of directory of output files to ${TRAIN_DATA_PATH}.
  * Set the path of configuration files to ${CONFIG_PATH}. You could specify different paths for each.
    * glomerulus_model.config
    * glomerulus_train.config
    * input.config
  * Set the GPU list you can use to ${GPU} like "--gpu_list=0,1" or "--gpu_list=1".
  
  If you get the error message of "ValueError: Tried to convert 't' to a tensor and failed. Error: Argument must be a dense tensor: range(0, 3) - got shape [3], but wanted [].",
  Please check [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/3752) and [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/3705#issuecomment-375563179).
